This is a mini-script to rename all files in any given folder you want on your computer, 
by deleting for instance all numbers and only leave the names with the letters,...etc.
This can be handy in case you have a lot of pictures you took with your camera 
in which they would have been named randomly by generating names with a mix of random numbers and letters.
So by deleting all numbers, the pictures then will be rearanged in an alphabetic order.

To do that, you only need to go to line of code # 6 and replace that directory with your folder directory.
Do the same thing with line of code # 10

In case you don't want to delete the numbers in your files names, but instead you want to delete other characters, 
all you need to do is to go to line of code # 13 and replace "0123456789" with any characters you want (such as letters 
or special characters). Do the same thing with line of code # 15.

The last thing you need to do is to go to line of code # 18 and replace the bellow "your original directory" 
with your actual original directory which you can get using the function os.getdir() function priort to running the script.
