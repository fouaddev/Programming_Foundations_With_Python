Controling the number of times the script reminds you of taking a break:
You can change the number of times the script reminds you to take a break by going to line of code # 5 and replacing # 3
by the number of times you like.

Controling the break period lengh before the script reminds you of taking a break:
You can change the period of time lengh (which is in seconds) by going to line of code # 6 and replacing # 10 (which is 10 seconds)
by the number of seconds you like.
If you want it to remind you every few hours, I would suggest you use this formula: number of seconds X number of minutes X number of hours
